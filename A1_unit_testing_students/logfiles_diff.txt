Differences about the logfiles and a breef explanation about them.

LOGFILE 1: In this logfile there are some errors given by the tests of the tasks other than the ones I did. The test functions of my task are
working but I couldn't make other people's tasks tests work. That's why 11 tests are failed.

LOGFILE 2: In this logfile we can encounter the same errors we had in the previous logfile but appart from them there are some more given
by the changes made in the checkout_and_payment class. Between these changes are the implementation of new functionality which was asked
in the assignment, which lead to some altered functions tests to stop working. This is what happened with the chack_cart function tests.
